# Foley's Of Duleek - Brian Stritch 2021 Project-1

Foley's of Duleek is a website that hopes to encourage locals to shop local and in turn by buying products at Foley's, locals are purchasing locally produced products. The website is targeted at the general public who would like to eat healthy, consuming locally sourced organic meat products, which in turn helps keep the community stable by sourcing within the local area and serving back to the community.

Foley's of Duleek website is a showcase of the products offered within the butcher shop and gives the user a general backround of the source of the organic products on offer and provides the user with a link to wikipedia in each meat sectio to the relevant content. Also included in the website is a brief overview of the alternative products on offer such as pre-packaged, frozen foods and dry foods and condiments.

Additionally Foley's of Duleek offers a rewards scheme to loyal customers who collect rewards points during every shop which can be redeemed within the shop in further discounts and members only special offers, and the attached form provides a customer a means to sign up and join the scheme.

### Existing Features

- __Navigation Bar__

  - Featured on all three pages, the full responsive navigation bar includes links to the Logo, Home page, Products, Special Offers, About, Contact, Gallery and Sign Up pages and is identical in each page to allow for easy navigation. 

  - A Burger icon menu navigation menu is also implemented and whilst at the top of the page the Burger navigation is hidden from view behind the page header and on scrolling down the page the burger icon reveals itself and remains fixed to the top right corner of the screen. The purpose of chosing the burger icon menu over a sticky header was to increase viewport size for the user and still allowing the user to access any area of the website by simply selecting the desired location. On larger screens the burger menu remains hidden at the top of the screen and to activate the dropdown menu the user must simply hover over the icon. 

  - On Devices with a width less than 1200px wide the navigation bar the navigation bar is designed to be hidden and the burger menu shows itself above the header and remains in the upper right corner at all times. The burger icon navigation menu at this device screen width and below is set to "onclick" for the purposes of being operated on tablets and mobile phones where the user would be unable to hover over the link. 

  - All navigation links are set to have a color change and a subtle box-shadow to show the user which link is being hovered over prior to selection.The above navigation type selection will allow the user to easily navigate from page to page and to specific sections across all devices without having to revert back to the previous page via the ‘back’ button. 

  - The navigation is set to scroll smooth so the user is aware that they have remained on the same page but have been redirected to a different section and the smooth action gives a positive experience to the user. 

![image of nav bar](assets/images/readme/navigation-bar.jpg)
- Above it can be noted that the Burger Navigation menu is hidden behind the header.
- Below is the Burger Navigation menu taken from a smaller device where the menu requires onclick to open and a second click to close. 
- On larger screens the Burger Navigation menu is set to display its contents when the mouse is hovered over the icon.

- __The landing page image__

  - This section allows the user to instantly recognise that this is a food based website due to the image of a piece of cooked meat being cut on a wooden chopping board, and the main hero image text overlay indicates that this is in fact a butchers website where such a piece of meat would be readily available for purchase. 

![image of Landing Page](assets/images/readme/landing-image.jpg)

- __Products-selectors__

  - The products selectors are intentionally designed to be visible at the lower area of the landing image, therefore prompting the user to scroll down the page. The images chosen for the selectors were chosen due to their appeal as they would be very appetising and would instantly draw the attention of the user, which allows the user to select a product and the link embedded within will redirect them to the relevant section on the page.

### Unfixed Bugs

While many bugs have been found during the development phase, such as layout issues,
font size issues, and links not working when commited to GitHub. The majority of these have all been
fixed in the final edition of this website. 

- The video iframe elements in the gallery scale up and down and at certain screen sizes appear to be either stretched slightly or compressed slightly.

- An issue was noted with the burger menu which, incorporated a javascript function "onclick" where the navigation icon would have to be clicked to open and clicked again to close. If left open on larger screens the dropdown list was visible when the icon was hidden. I attempted to rectify this by stating "mouseover" in place of "onclick" however this created a glich. In the end i duplicated the complete burger menu code block, removed the javascript and set to display on hover which fixed this issue. A secondary issue then arose where on a media device you cannot hover so the navigation was inoperable. The resolution to this was to create two burger menu batches of code with two seperate classes and have one visible at one screen size and up and the other one visible from thatsize down which allowed for the crossover and hence allowing the two seperate trigger types to operate when needed. When not in use display is set to none on the required block of code. 

Some minor issues were noted with responsiveness on different size devices and a happy medium had to be achieved as i could not get the site to appear uniform on all different types of media devices,

## Deployment

- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows: 
  - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab 
  - in settings select pages on the menu along left hand side.
  - select branch in the source section and change setting to main
  - Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.

 - ### __Structure__
    - __Information Architecture (IA)__ 
      A basic tree structure layout . 
        - ![Structure layout](assets/images/structure.jpg)
  - __Interaction Design (IXD)__ 
    - The first area the user will encounter is the Home page, where the navigation bar is located at the top right of the      page. The navigation bar is found at the top of all the pages of the website. Each link in the main navigation bar is clearly marked out with a hover feature so the user can clearly see which items they are selecting. 
    - An additional hamburger icon navigation menu is fixed to the screen in the upper right corner, which is hidden behind the main navigation bar when at the top of the page, so as to not confuse the user, but on scrolling down the page it reveals itself and remains in place allowing the user to navigate to anywhere in the website without restricting the viewport height allowing for a more pleasurable experience. When the user hovers their mouse over the hamburger menu on larger screens a dropdown menu appears allowing the user to navigate to the area of their liking.
    - On mobile devices the main navigation bar disappears, and the hamburger menu comes forward to sit above the header and is always in full sight of the user. It is located to the top-right of the screen in the same position as it is found on larger screens. This when pressed drops the navigation menu so the user can select their destination within the website. Each link is clearly marked out with a hover feature so the user can clearly see which link is being selected. 
    - On desktop each navigation link has a gentle hover to show that the area is active and the active page has an underline indicating which page the user is currently on. Once clicked or pressed the link will smoothly take the user to whichever section they desire. 
    The gallery and video areas are close together for easy access to jump from one to another. The media player will play clips of videos on you tube which directly relate to the sourcing of the products for the shop. An audio file has been included thanking the user for visiting the website and requests that the user visit the shop. The user has control over the play, pause rewind, fast-forward and volume functions.
    - The site includes hyperlinks to external sources on Wikipedia for additional information which relates to the content found in this website.
    The site also incorporates a rewards page which includes a sign up form which gathers data via the input fields and submits the data to the code institute database and returns a table of the contents gathered. The sign up form also includes a clear button which clears all the data fields.
    Each social media link also has a hover effect so the user knows the link is active and it will take the user to the relevant platform requested.
